Getting Started
===

To get started follow the below instructions. 

1. Make a personal account at https://github.com/ with your @yale.edu email.

**Explanation:** just do it.

2. Now go to https://education.github.com/ and request free private repos. 

**Explanation:** Sicne you used your @yale.edu email above you will get 5 private repos for 2 years. After 2 years github will send another email to your @yale.edu email to test that it is still active, if it is you will get another 2 years for free (I think that this will continue forever.)


3. Send me your Github username, and I will add you as an administrator of the Gerstein_Lab github organization account. 

**Explanation:** There are two types of accounts personal and organizational. If you completed step 2 correctly you will have a maximum of 5 free private repos. The Gerstein_Lab organization has a maximum of 10 private repositories (which we pay for).
