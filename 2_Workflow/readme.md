Workflow
===

###General overview

I start by making a private repo in my personal account. Once I have everything in order I transfer the repository to the Gerstein_Lab group. This is accomplished by setting->danger zone-> transfer this repo. then transfer it to gerstein_lab. 


###Code for a paper 

If the poject that you are transfering to the Gerstein_Labâ€™s account is for a paper being submitted then i recomment that you spend some time to make a nice readme.md file in the base directory (for an example see https://github.com/gersteinlab/MUSIC). For more infomration on Github flavered markdown see https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/ 


###Code being worked on by multiple people

If you are working on a project with multiple people you can add them as team members of the repository by clicking on settings-> collaborators -> add collaborators . What this does is allows them to make changes to the repo without you having to ok it every time. 


###Document 

Github is most well known for code but you can also work on documents. This github_HowTo  is an exaple of a reposity containing only readme.md documents.
