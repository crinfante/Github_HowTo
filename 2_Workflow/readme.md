Workflow
===

I start by making a private repo in my personal account. Once I have everything in order 

When you make change to the code you push them to github, finally when you are ready to publish your analysis/tool/whatever you would go to setting->danger zone-> transfer this repo. then transfer it to gerstein_lab. At this point you there are two other thing that i need to mention. 

1. you want to think about making a nice read me and/or a github pages page for your repository (more this below)

2. you will want to update the tools page

3. you will want to add the correct licence to your code (more about that below)

4. if you just want to give people a like to download your code as a .zip file then you would do this
